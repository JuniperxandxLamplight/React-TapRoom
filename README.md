# _NeighborSpace_

#### _A website created for use in a bar or taproom to keep track of keg fullness and inventory, 4/19/19_

#### By _**Aurora Shido-Wagenet**_

## Description

_This application provides the ability to add kegs, track their fullness, and order more kegs for the purposes of organization in restaurant settings. It is a companion to the angular taproom project I've made. The differences between Angular and React in theory aren't that completely different but I find React much more intuitive. Holding all the code for one component in one file and then just passing data down as arguments make a lot of sense. I find not having to switch between the files does speed up the development process quite a bit, as well as being able to always know where data is stored._

## Notes

### Unforseen Issues
_Webpack configuring took longer than expected; getting everything working perfectly in that might be a longer process than coding any individual feature_
_PropTypes aren't working; the props themselves are but I'm not sure why the PropTypes woudln't be._
_Styling between components can be tricky. Sometimes I needed to set the width in the parent component instead._
